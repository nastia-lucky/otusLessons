It is needed to run "mvn clean test -D={browser} -P={env}" command for test launch 
where {browser} is browser where the application is run (chrome, opera and firefox are supported) 
and {env} is environment where application is run (dev and prod are supported but "dev" is for demo purposes only so run it only on prod ).
